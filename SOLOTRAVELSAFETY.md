## üó£Ô∏è Brand Voice & Tone

**Solo Travel Safety speaks like your smart, streetwise travel BFF.**

We're calm, clear, and data-backed ‚Äî never alarmist, never fluffy.
Supportive but real. Witty when it helps.

**We're always:**
- Empowering, not patronizing
- Informative, not overwhelming
- Warm and relatable, not corporate or cold

> Think: "Know before you go ‚Äî not freak out before you fly."

### Tone Examples

**Wrong (too alarmist):**
> "This city is dangerous for women. Avoid going out at night."

**Right (STS tone):**
> "Most women felt safe here during the day. Use extra caution in less-lit areas after dark."

**Wrong (too casual/patronizing):**
> "Ladies, just be chill and you'll be fine lol."

**Right (STS tone):**
> "If you're traveling alone, we recommend staying in central neighborhoods with good reviews from other solo women."

## üåç Market Context

The solo female travel market is $260B+ ‚Äî but most women still rely on Reddit threads and gut instinct to stay safe. STS aims to change that with a dedicated space for safety, trust, and empowerment ‚Äî and maybe even save lives along the way.

**84% of solo women travelers report feeling unsafe on the road.** Most rely on fragmented sources (Reddit, blogs, TripAdvisor) and gut instinct. STS fills the massive trust gap in the solo travel market by offering a centralized, verified, women-led safety tool.
