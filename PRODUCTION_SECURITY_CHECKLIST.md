  - Policy: User-specific WHERE clauses in all RLS policies

- [ ] **No privilege escalation possible**
  - Test: Try changing user roles/permissions ‚Üí Should fail
  - Check: Admin role separation implemented

### Data Protection
- [ ] **Input validation on all endpoints**
  - Test: Send malicious payloads (XSS, SQL) ‚Üí Should be sanitized
  - Files: `src/lib/supabase-secure.ts`, validation functions

- [ ] **File upload security**
  - Test: Upload non-image files ‚Üí Should be rejected
  - Test: Upload files > size limit ‚Üí Should be rejected
  - Check: File type validation, size limits, user-specific folders

- [ ] **No sensitive data exposure**

- [ ] **CORS properly configured**
  - Test: Requests from unauthorized domains ‚Üí Should be blocked
  - Check: No wildcard (*) CORS in production

- [ ] **Rate limiting implemented**
  - Test: Rapid-fire requests ‚Üí Should hit rate limits
  - Check: Different limits for different endpoints

  - Check: Response times monitored
  - Check: Error rates tracked

### Privacy & Compliance
- [ ] **Data retention policies**
  - Check: Old data automatically cleaned up
  - Check: User data deletion workflows

- [ ] **Privacy controls**
  - Check: Users can control data visibility

## üõ†Ô∏è **Security Testing Commands**

### 1. Authentication Tests
```bash
# Test unauthenticated access
curl -X POST https://your-api.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool": "get_user_profile", "arguments": {"user_id": "any-id"}}'
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test with invalid token
curl -X POST https://your-api.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool": "get_user_profile", "arguments": {"user_id": "any-id"}}'
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

### 2. Input Validation Tests
```bash
# Test XSS injection
curl -X POST https://your-api.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-VALID-TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool": "search_destinations", "arguments": {"query": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}}'
# Expected: Sanitized response, no script execution

# Test SQL injection
curl -X POST https://your-api.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-VALID-TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool": "search_destinations", "arguments": {"query": "'; DROP TABLE users; --"}}'
# Expected: Treated as literal string, no SQL execution
```

### 3. Rate Limiting Tests
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST https://your-api.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-VALID-TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"tool": "get_recent_reviews", "arguments": {"limit": 10}}'
done
# Expected: 429 Rate Limit Exceeded after configured limit
```

### 4. CORS Tests
```bash
# Test CORS from unauthorized domain
curl -X POST https://your-api.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp \
  -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-VALID-TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool": "get_recent_reviews", "arguments": {"limit": 10}}'
# Expected: CORS error or blocked
```

## üîç **Database Security Verification**

### 1. RLS Policy Tests
```sql
-- Test as unauthorized user
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id != 'current-user-id';
-- Expected: Empty result set

-- Test newsletter access
SELECT * FROM newsletter_signups;
-- Expected: Only own records or empty if not admin

-- Test review modification
UPDATE reviews SET review_text = 'hacked' WHERE user_id != 'current-user-id';
-- Expected: Permission denied
```

### 2. Storage Security Tests
```bash
# Test direct file access
curl https://your-supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/avatars/other-user-id/avatar.jpg
# Expected: Access denied or 404

# Test file upload to other user's folder
curl -X POST https://your-supabase.co/storage/v1/object/avatars/other-user-id/malicious.jpg \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
  --data-binary @test-file.jpg
# Expected: Permission denied
```
