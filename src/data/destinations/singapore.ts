    description: 'Is Singapore safe for solo female travelers? Singapore ranks #6 globally as the safest country for women traveling alone, with an exceptional 4.8/5 safety rating. This ultra-modern city-state combines world-class safety infrastructure, strict laws, and multicultural harmony, making it the perfect stress-free destination for solo female travelers seeking urban adventures with complete peace of mind.',

      nightSafety: { 
        score: 8.8, 
        context: 'Singapore is exceptionally safe at night with one of the world\'s lowest crime rates after dark. Well-lit streets throughout the city, extensive CCTV coverage (over 90,000 cameras), and regular police patrols create an ultra-safe environment. Solo female travelers regularly walk alone at midnight without concern. Even nightlife districts like Clarke Quay and Marina Bay remain secure with dedicated security presence. The only areas requiring mild caution are isolated parts of East Coast Park after 1 AM and Geylang red-light district, though both remain relatively safe by international standards.'

      publicTransit: { 
        score: 9.5, 
        context: 'Singapore\'s MRT and bus system ranks among the world\'s safest public transport networks. Every station and train car has CCTV monitoring, emergency communication buttons, and platform screen doors for accident prevention. Women-only train cars operate during rush hours (7-9 AM, 6-8 PM) on select lines. Staff patrol regularly, and sexual harassment incidents are virtually non-existent due to strict enforcement. The system operates with 99.9% reliability, and English announcements ensure solo travelers never get lost. Late-night services until midnight (2 AM weekends) with well-lit stations and covered walkways to residential areas.'

      walkingAlone: { 
        score: 8.9, 
        context: 'Walking alone in Singapore is remarkably safe with street harassment being extremely rare due to strict anti-harassment laws and cultural respect for women. The city features comprehensive pedestrian infrastructure including covered walkways, well-maintained sidewalks, and excellent lighting. Police response time averages 11 minutes, and emergency call boxes are strategically placed throughout the city. Solo female travelers report feeling safer walking in Singapore than in their home countries. The integrated urban planning ensures women can walk safely between MRT stations, shopping areas, and accommodations at any hour. Cultural norms strongly discourage bothering strangers, creating a respectful environment for independent women.'
