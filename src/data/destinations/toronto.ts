    description: 'Is Toronto safe for solo female travelers? Toronto ranks #4 globally as the safest city in the world and the highest-rated North American city for solo female travelers, with Canada achieving #18 globally with a 4.7/5 safety rating. This multicultural metropolis combines Canadian politeness, world-class safety infrastructure, and extremely low harassment rates, making it one of the most welcoming destinations for women traveling alone seeking urban adventure with complete security.',
    safetyBreakdown: {
      nightSafety: { 
        score: 8.2, 
        context: 'Toronto maintains exceptional night safety with comprehensive street lighting throughout downtown and residential areas. Solo female travelers consistently report feeling secure walking alone even after midnight in well-populated districts. While homeless populations in certain downtown areas may cause discomfort, violent crime remains extremely rare. Police response times average 8-12 minutes, and emergency call boxes are strategically placed throughout the city. Areas like Yorkville, The Annex, and Financial District remain active and safe well into late hours.'

        context: 'Toronto\'s TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) system achieves world-class safety standards with comprehensive CCTV coverage, emergency alarms in all vehicles, and professional staff oversight. The system operates with 95% reliability and maintains excellent cleanliness standards. SafeTTC app allows discrete reporting of safety concerns directly to Transit Control. While the system serves some challenging neighborhoods, incidents affecting solo female travelers are extremely rare, and the network provides safe, efficient access to all major city areas.'

        context: 'Walking alone in Toronto benefits from Canada\'s deeply respectful cultural norms where bothering strangers is strongly discouraged. The city features excellent sidewalk infrastructure, comprehensive lighting systems, and active street life during most hours. Solo female travelers report virtually no catcalling or street harassment - a testament to Canadian politeness. The main considerations involve avoiding poorly lit areas in certain neighborhoods after dark and being aware of homeless encampments in downtown areas, though aggressive panhandling is uncommon.'
