    safetySummaryForSEO: 'Is Lagos safe for women solo travelers? Lagos presents significant challenges for solo female travel safety with very low confidence scores and high harassment risks. While some women have traveled successfully to Lagos, expert sources consistently recommend extreme caution. Solo female travel safety precautions must include 24/7 hotel security, private transportation, and comprehensive emergency planning. Women traveling alone safety requires international hotel accommodation, embassy contact information, and continuous communication with trusted contacts. Solo travel safety for women beginners should consider Lagos only as a brief transit point with professional security arrangements.',
