    culturalSensitivityTips: [
      'Brazilian culture prioritizes relationships, warmth, and social connections above efficiency or formality. Solo female travelers who embrace the relationship-building approach and show genuine interest in people will experience authentic Brazilian hospitality and often gain protective social networks.',
      'The concept of "jeitinho brasileiro" (the Brazilian way) represents creative problem-solving and flexibility in challenging situations. Solo female travelers who appreciate this cultural adaptability and avoid rigid expectations will better navigate Brazilian social and practical situations.',
      'Carnival culture extends far beyond the famous festival, representing Brazilian values of celebration, music, dance, and community joy. Solo female travelers who show appreciation for this festive spirit and participate respectfully in cultural celebrations will connect with fundamental Rio identity.',
      'Brazilian physical affection and warmth in social interactions should not be misinterpreted. Solo female travelers should understand that closer personal space, touching during conversation, and expressive communication reflect cultural norms of friendliness rather than romantic interest.',
      'Portuguese language appreciation is crucial in Rio, where speaking Spanish or assuming similarity to Spanish can be offensive. Learning basic Portuguese phrases like "Oi" (hi), "Obrigada" (thank you - feminine), and "Com licença" (excuse me) shows cultural respect.',
      'Family values are central to Brazilian culture, with multi-generational households and strong family loyalty influencing social decisions. Solo female travelers who show interest in family traditions and understand that family often takes priority will better navigate Brazilian social customs.',
      'Brazilian music and dance culture, from samba to bossa nova, represents artistic expressions of cultural identity and social bonding. Solo female travelers who show appreciation for musical traditions and participate respectfully will experience important aspects of Rio culture.',
      'Food culture involves sharing, hospitality, and regional pride in Brazilian cuisine. Solo female travelers who embrace communal eating, try local dishes, and show appreciation for Brazilian culinary traditions will connect with fundamental cultural values.',

    ],
    culturalContext: {
      socialDynamics: 'Rio society is warm, expressive, and highly social. Cariocas (Rio locals) are known for their openness, love of music/dance, and appreciation of natural beauty. However, machismo culture means solo women may face more direct attention than in other destinations.',
      communicationStyle: 'Brazilians communicate expressively with gestures, close physical proximity, and emotional openness. Conversations tend to be animated and personal topics are discussed freely. Indirect communication is less common than in Asian cultures.',
      familyImportance: 'Family is central to Brazilian culture. Extended families often live close together and socialize frequently. Solo travelers may be invited to family gatherings - this is a genuine honor showing acceptance.',
      religiousInfluence: 'While Brazil is majority Catholic, Rio has significant religious diversity including Evangelical Christianity, Afro-Brazilian religions (Candomblé, Umbanda), and spiritualism. Religious tolerance is high.',
      beachCulture: 'Beaches are social hubs regardless of economic status. Body positivity is strong - all ages, sizes, and backgrounds mix freely. Beach vendors, sports, music, and socializing happen constantly from sunrise to sunset.',
      musicAndDance: 'Music is fundamental to Carioca identity. Samba, bossa nova, funk carioca, and pagode are part of daily life. Dancing is social expectation - showing rhythm appreciation gains instant acceptance.',
      economicDivides: 'Rio has extreme income inequality visible everywhere. Luxury condos coexist with favelas. Understanding this context helps solo travelers navigate social dynamics and avoid inadvertent insensitivity.',
      timeOrientation: 'Brazilian time is flexible - social events start 30-60 minutes late. Business meetings may begin 15 minutes late. This relaxed approach to punctuality is cultural, not disrespectful.',
      personalSpace: 'Physical contact during conversation is normal - touching arms, standing close, hugs/kisses for greetings. Solo women should understand this is cultural, not romantic interest, but maintain personal boundaries.',
      foodCulture: 'Meals are social events lasting hours. Lunch is main meal (12-3pm). Dinner starts late (8-10pm). Sharing food shows friendship. Street food culture is strong but requires safety awareness for solo travelers.',
      politicalSensitivity: 'Brazilians are passionate about politics but topics can be divisive. Recent political polarization means avoiding political discussions is safest for tourists. Focus on culture, sports, or travel topics instead.',
      genderDynamics: 'Traditional gender roles persist alongside modern equality. Solo women travelers may experience more protective behavior from locals but also more persistent romantic attention. Setting clear boundaries respectfully is important.'
